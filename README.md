# IFCescu

A fully client-side web app to **view and edit IFC building models** in the
browser. Inspect a model in an interactive WebGPU 3D viewer, edit element
attributes and property/quantity values **directly in the 3D view**, add property
sets (standard buildingSMART psets or custom ones), validate against **IDS**,
review **BCF** topics, build pivot **data tables**, place the model on a 3D
**globe** in real-world context, and (an opt-in experimental module) **georeference
it onto live ANCPI cadastral parcels** — then export an edited, non-destructive
`.ifc`. A **Settings** dialog tunes units/formatting and the 3D viewer, and gates
experimental features.

Everything runs **in the browser**: there is no backend, so it can be hosted as a
static site (e.g. GitHub Pages). IFC parsing, geometry, mutation and export are
handled by [**@ifc-lite**](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite) (a Rust → WebAssembly
core), 3D rendering by **`@ifc-lite/renderer`** (WebGPU), and the globe by
[**CesiumJS**](https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/). Georeferencing targets the
Romanian national projection **Stereo 70 (EPSG:3844)** with vertical datum
**Marea Neagră 1975**.

Built with **Vite + React + TypeScript** and the buildingSMART colour palette with
a light/dark theme toggle. The UI ships in **Romanian (default)** and **English**,
switchable at runtime from a button in the top-right (the choice is remembered).

> ⚠️ **The 3D viewer requires WebGPU** (recent Chrome/Edge, or Safari 18+). The app
> gates on `navigator.gpu` and shows a notice when it's unavailable — **data
> editing, export, and the Cesium globe still work** without WebGPU.

> ℹ️ **The `@ifc-lite` core is a prebuilt npm dependency**, not source in this repo.
> There is **no Rust toolchain, `wasm-pack`, or shader build** here — `npm install`
> pulls the prebuilt `.wasm` and WebGPU/WGSL assets from the `@ifc-lite/*` packages.
> To change the core itself, work in the upstream
> [`LTplus-AG/ifc-lite`](https://github.com/LTplus-AG/ifc-lite) repo and bump the
> versions in `package.json`.

## Features

- **In-view editing** — select an element and edit it in place: IfcRoot attributes
  (Name, Description, ObjectType, Tag) and existing property/quantity values across
  its psets and `Qto_*` sets. Add a property to an existing pset, or add a whole pset
  — standard class psets (the `Pset_*` applicable to the element's IFC class and its
  supertypes, from `@ifc-lite/data`) or custom ones. Edits apply to an in-memory
  overlay; **non-destructive export** (`@ifc-lite/export`) rewrites only the entities
  you touched and preserves every other record with full numeric precision.
- **3D viewer (WebGPU)** — streaming geometry load, click-to-select with a lime
  silhouette outline, and a resizable properties panel (grouped psets, `Qto_*` last,
  pin favourites, and a model overview + OpenStreetMap location card when nothing is
  selected).
- **Model federation** — load multiple IFC models into one scene via the **Modele**
  panel; the first (**primary ★**) sets the origin and the rest are placed by their
  georeference offset. The tree, selection, properties, editing and data table work
  across all loaded models; globe, IDS and BCF operate on the primary. A **color by
  model** toggle paints each model a distinct color to tell them apart.
- **Structure tree** — Spatial / Class / Material tabs, one root per model, elements
  grouped by class, with a **search field** that filters by name or class and
  auto-expands the matches. The panel **auto-fits its width** to the longest visible
  label (grow-only, capped) so deep/long names are not truncated; still resizable by hand.
- **Measure** — length / point / area with selectable object snapping (endpoint,
  midpoint, edge, face); the point tool reports IFC X/Y/Z and Stereo 70 E/N/H when
  georeferenced. Length/area readouts follow the unit + decimal settings, and when
  the cadastre module is on, snapping extends to parcel corners (measure model ↔ plot).
- **Section** — a single clip plane created by double-clicking a face, with a
  draggable handle and size/flip controls.
- **Saved views** — store the current camera and visibility from the **Views** menu and
  return to them anytime; the list is remembered per file in `localStorage`.
- **Data table (pivot)** — docked, resizable table that groups elements by
  Model / class / material / property / quantity and aggregates value columns
  (sum/avg/count/min/max), with row→3D selection and CSV export. A **bill-of-quantities**
  preset groups by class → material and sums the base quantities, and a **printable
  report** opens a styled page you can save as PDF.
- **Analytics dashboard (Power BI-style, experimental, off by default)** — enable it in Settings; it opens a
  **resizable bottom dock** (the 3D stays visible above) with movable, resizable visuals (bars, donut, treemap,
  stacked bars by two dimensions, quantity histogram, KPI cards) over any dimension (class, material, property,
  quantity) with count or sum measures, built on the same pivot layer. Clicking a category **cross-filters every
  other visual** (they recompute) **and** the 3D viewer (isolates + colors the matching elements; OR within a
  chart, AND across charts). A dependency-free drag/resize grid; charts via Recharts — lazy-loaded so it stays
  out of the initial bundle.
- **Clash detection (experimental, off by default)** — enable it in Settings; it opens a **resizable bottom
  dock** (the 3D stays visible above) that checks **geometric interference** between two element sets (**Set A x
  Set B**, by model). It finds **hard clashes** (overlapping geometry) and **clearance clashes** (gap below a
  threshold) with a grid-accelerated AABB broad phase, and an optional **triangle-triangle narrow phase**
  (Moller test) that confirms real interference, **ignores mere surface contact** (e.g. a beam resting on a
  slab) and reports the **true penetration** depth (not the inflated bounding-box overlap). Clicking a clash
  **isolates, colors (A red / B orange) and frames the interference region** in 3D; each clash carries a
  **status** (new/active/resolved/approved/ignored) persisted per file-set in `localStorage`. **Send to BCF**
  creates one topic + viewpoint per clash (camera framed on the clash, the two elements isolated + colored) and
  opens the BCF panel to export the `.bcfzip`; results also **export to CSV**. Set A / Set B are multi-select
  dropdowns. Pure client-side, built on the engine's retained per-element bounds and geometry; the panel is
  lazy-loaded.
- **Filter & select** — a rule-based query builder (IFC type *is one of*, property
  `pset.name operator value`, or name contains/equals/regex) combined with AND/OR; Run
  to **select or isolate** the matches in 3D.
- **IDS** — validate the primary model against an uploaded IDS specification, **and author
  IDS in-app**: the IDS creator (✎) builds specifications across all six facets
  (Entity/Attribute/Property/Classification/Material/PartOf), exports a `.ids`, loads an
  existing one to edit, and validates directly against the model.
- **BCF** — full topic collaboration: create topics from the current view, **add comments** (optionally
  with the current view attached), **edit status / type / priority / assignee / due date**, and **delete**
  topics; import/export `.bcfzip`; and **open a topic's viewpoint** (↗ 3D) to reproduce it in 3D — camera
  + isolation + coloring + selection (so topics generated from IDS validation or clash detection restore
  their exact view), with a **Reset the view** button that returns the model to a neutral state (full
  visibility, no isolation/coloring/selection, including the IDS overlay). BCF enum values are kept
  verbatim for round-trip fidelity.
- **Globe (Cesium)** — place georeferenced models (or models already in real Stereo 70
  coordinates) on a token-free 3D world map with OSM/Esri basemaps, terrain, and an
  earth-transparency slider; a bundled **EGM2008** geoid grid provides the geoid
  undulation readout. Fetched cadastral parcels are draped on the terrain as polygons.
- **Settings** — a gear-button dialog (saved to `localStorage`): **experimental
  features** (gates the cadastre, bSDD, analytics and clash modules — off by default), **units & formatting**
  (length m/cm/mm, area m²/ha, decimals), and **3D viewer** (background, projection
  perspective/orthographic, navigation cube, view bar, default snapping).
- **bSDD (experimental, off by default)** — enable it in Settings to connect to the online
  [buildingSMART Data Dictionary](https://api.bsdd.buildingsmart.org): select one or more elements,
  pick a dictionary (IFC, Uniclass, …), search a class, and assign it as a real
  `IfcClassificationReference` (via `IfcRelAssociatesClassification`) and/or write the class's
  bSDD-defined properties (with values) into property sets. The request is proxied in dev (`/bsdd`);
  in a static production build the direct call may be CORS-blocked unless the domain is on bSDD's allow-list.
- **Cadastre — ANCPI (experimental, off by default)** — enable it in Settings to
  georeference a model onto real-world parcels: fetch ANCPI cadastral parcels
  (Stereo 70 GeoJSON) within a radius auto-centred on the model, draw them in the 3D
  scene and on the globe, hover/click a parcel for its number + area, then align the
  model with a **two-point** correspondence (snap a model point + a parcel corner, ×2),
  apply it live, and **write the `IfcMapConversion`** into the exported `.ifc`. The
  ANCPI request is proxied in dev (`/ancpi`) to avoid CORS.
- **Navigation** — a ViewCube overlay (click a face / drag to orbit) plus the
  keyboard shortcuts below.
- **Language** — the whole UI switches between **Romanian (default)** and
  **English** at runtime via the top-right RO/EN button; the preference is saved to
  `localStorage`. IFC technical terms (class names, `Pset_*`/`Qto_*`, `GlobalId`,
  schema, `Stereo 70`) stay verbatim in both languages.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (LTS; CI builds on Node 20) and **npm**.
- A **WebGPU-capable browser** for the 3D viewer — recent Chrome/Edge, or Safari 18+.
  (Editing, export, and the globe work without WebGPU.)
- **No** Rust toolchain or `wasm-pack` — the `@ifc-lite` WASM core ships prebuilt via npm.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install      # installs deps, including the prebuilt @ifc-lite WASM core
npm run dev      # Vite dev server (default http://localhost:5173)
npm run build    # type-check (tsc --noEmit) + production build to dist/
npm run preview  # serve the built dist/ locally (default http://localhost:4173)
```

## Testing

```bash
npm test         # vitest run
```

The suite lives in `tests/`:

- **`geo.test.ts`** — crs (Stereo 70 ↔ WGS84), geoid undulation, and placement-mode
  unit tests. Pure math; always runs.
- **`align.test.ts`** — two-point georeferencing solver (rotation/translation/scale,
  residual, round-trip back onto the targets). Pure math; always runs.
- **`writeMapConversion.test.ts`** — STEP-text writer for the cadastre export: updates
  an existing `IfcMapConversion`, injects one (+ `IfcProjectedCRS`) when absent, and
  leaves IFC2x3 untouched. Always runs.
- **`idsWriter.test.ts`** — the IDS serializer: round-trips an authored `IDSDocument`
  (every facet + constraint) through `serializeIds` → `parseIdsXml` and audits the XML.
  Always runs.
- **`boqReport.test.ts`** — the bill-of-quantities preset builder (`boqPresetConfig`):
  groups by class → material and picks the present base quantities. Pure; always runs.
- **`clash.test.ts`** — clash detection: AABB hard/clearance classification, pair dedup +
  self-exclusion, the triangle-triangle intersection test (crossing / separated / coplanar),
  narrow-phase false-positive rejection, status persistence and the async/cancel path. Pure;
  always runs.
- **`createSite.test.ts`** — `IfcEditor` round-trip on an inline minimal IFC4 model
  (edit attribute + property + new pset, then export and re-open). Self-contained;
  always runs.
- **`editor.test.ts`** — the same round-trip against a real IFC file. It is guarded by
  `describe.runIf(...)` and **skips** unless a sample is available; point it at one with
  `IFC_SAMPLE=<path>` (default is a local path that won't exist on most machines).

## Configuration

All build config is in [`vite.config.ts`](vite.config.ts) (each option is commented):

- `base: "./"` — relative asset URLs, so the build works at any GitHub Pages path.
- `build.target: "esnext"` (and the matching `optimizeDeps.esbuildOptions.target`) —
  `@ifc-lite/ids` uses top-level `await`, which needs a modern target.
- `worker.format: "es"` — `@ifc-lite` workers are loaded as ES modules.
- `optimizeDeps.exclude: [@ifc-lite/parser, geometry, renderer, wasm]` — keeps Vite
  from pre-bundling these so their `new URL(..., import.meta.url)` worker/WASM asset
  references resolve correctly.
- `vite-plugin-cesium` copies Cesium's static assets and sets `window.CESIUM_BASE_URL`
  for the globe view.
- `server.proxy["/ancpi"]` — dev-only reverse proxy to `geoportal.ancpi.ro` so the
  cadastre module's parcel fetch isn't blocked by CORS. In a static production build
  there is no proxy, so the direct ANCPI call may be CORS-blocked (a backend/proxy
  would be needed there).

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

Because `vite.config.ts` sets `base: "./"`, the build works at any Pages path without
changes. [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) runs `npm ci`
+ `npm run build` and publishes `dist/` on every push to `main` (enable **Settings →
Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**). Cesium's assets and the `@ifc-lite` WASM + geometry
workers are bundled by Vite at build time; the 3D viewer still needs a WebGPU-capable
browser at runtime, but editing/export and the globe do not.

## Notes

- **Engine:** parsing, geometry, editing and export run on `@ifc-lite`; rendering runs
  on `@ifc-lite/renderer` (WebGPU). IFC2X3 / IFC4 / IFC4X3 are parsed natively.
- **WebGPU is required for the 3D viewer** — there is no WebGL fallback in the renderer.
- **Export is non-destructive** — `@ifc-lite/export` regenerates STEP while preserving
  every untouched record with full numeric precision (Stereo 70 eastings/northings keep
  all significant digits); only the entities you edited change.
- **Section** clips against a single plane at a time; creating a new one replaces it.
- **Snapping** is computed app-side from retained geometry, so the snap methods are
  fully selectable and the glyphs are precise.
- The **Cesium globe is token-free** (no Cesium ion token). Horizontal Stereo 70 → WGS84
  uses a 7-parameter Helmert (≈ sub-2 m) — fine for context, not a cadastral-grade grid.
- Large IFC files are parsed client-side, so they take longer to open; very large
  georeferenced models use `@ifc-lite`'s RTC origin to avoid float32 jitter.
- The location card and map/Earth links need network access (they stay empty offline).
```
